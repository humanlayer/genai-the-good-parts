**GenAI, the good Parts**: A set of AI tutorials for engineers in a hurry. Designed to cut through the hype / frameworks and focus on the core use cases.


## Welcome to the Early Access Program (EAP) for GenAI the Good Parts

If you're here, you've been invited to review early versions of chapters for GenAI the good parts.

As chapters reach GA, they will be copied to a public version of this repo at some regular cadence.
