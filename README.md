**GenAI, The Good Parts**: A set of AI tutorials for engineers in a hurry. Designed to cut through the hype/frameworks and focus on core use cases.

## Welcome to the Early Access Program (EAP) for _GenAI, The Good Parts_.

If you're here, you've been invited to review early versions of chapters.

(The main README is now in [README-pub.md](./README-pub.md), use that to get started.)

### How this private repo works

All chapters will be published here - they'll get an Alpha/Beta/GA tag so you know what level of quality to expect.

As chapters reach GA, they will be copied to a public version of this repo at some regular cadence.

They will also be posted to https://genaibook.substack.com/. Feel free to drop a subscribe there as well!

### How to contribute

- Read the chapters, run the code in the examples, try to do the exercises
- Give feedback in the Discord Channel: https://discord.gg/4DVgayVa8j
- Open issues for problems or suggestions
- Contribute new content, sections or even whole chapters. Start with an issue and let's discuss!
- Refer a Friend - you can intro us on LinkedIn or via email at [dexter@humanlayer.dev](mailto:dexter@humanlayer.dev).
